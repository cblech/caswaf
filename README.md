# caswaf - C++ ASynchronous Web Application Framework
This Project is in a very early development state.

The plan is to create a Web Application Framework, that automaticly makes a Website asynchronous. This should decrease loadingtimes and make a Website feel mutch faster.
## Note
You need to install boost. Otherwise precompileHTML does not compile.
